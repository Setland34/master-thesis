\textbf{Motivation.} The information stored in build logs can and has
already been used for a variety of applications. One prominent dataset
in the space, TravisTorrent, was featured as the MSR Data Challenge
2017~\cite{msr17challenge}. To date, scientist and practitioners alike
have used it and other, proprietary datasets to understand and
cateogrize Continuous Integration build
failures~\cite{islam2017insights}, to do research on testing
practices~\cite{orellana2017differences}, to train classifiers to
predict the build outcome and
duration~\cite{ni2017cost,bisong2017built,machalica2019predictive},
and to investigate static analysis tools in CI
builds~\cite{zampetti2017open}. Therefore, being able to efficiently
and correctly extract information from build logs is paramount to the
future of a variety of fields depending on it.

\section{Related Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CI research? could show how researchers could use chunk retrieval for existing studies (then I would only mention studies that do build log analysis)
	\item build log augmentation (BART paper, ICSE Amar et al.)
	\item ``foundational techniques'', e.g. explaining how PROSE synthesis algorithm works, I would move to the explanation of the method
\end{itemize}

\section{Chunk Retrieval Techniques}
general: what is a chunk retrieval technique

should I include the "how is a build log generated" and (some of, one) the examples for retrievable information?

less plots! -> can I only mention the results and just not show the plots showing then?
