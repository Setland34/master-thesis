\section{Related Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CI research? could show how researchers could use chunk retrieval for existing studies (then I would only mention studies that do build log analysis)
	\item build log augmentation (BART paper, ICSE Amar et al.)
	\item ``foundational techniques'', e.g. explaining how PROSE synthesis algorithm works, I would move to the explanation of the method
\end{itemize}

\section{Chunk Retrieval Techniques}
general: what is a chunk retrieval technique

should I include the "how is a build log generated" and (some of, one) the examples for retrievable information?

\section{Empirical Comparsion}
\subsection{Data Set}
short explanation of content and reference to the MSR paper
\subsection{Tool Implementation}
stating that (and in which languages) we implemented the techniques (will be very short, integrate somewhere else?)

\subsection{Results}
like in thesis?

less plots! -> can I only mention the results and just not show the plots showing then?
