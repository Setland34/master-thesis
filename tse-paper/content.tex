\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion-fw}
The goal of this paper was to support researchers and developers in
their decision on how to analyze build logs. We implemented and
compared three different chunk retrieval techniques on our data set
\emph{LogChunks}, composed of 797 manually labeled build logs from a
broad range of 80 repositories. Our results show that the structural
representation of the targeted information in the build logs is the
main factor to consider when choosing a suitable technique. Secondary
factors are the desired confidence into recall and precision of the
produced output and whether precision or recall is more important for
the task at hand.

As a final recommendation, one could create a ``super analyzer'' by
combining the different build log analysis techniques studied in this
paper.
