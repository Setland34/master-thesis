\section{Introduction}

shortening fixing time for broken builds important to increase dev productivity,
 
to detect underlying failure huge buildlog has to be read, dev has to find relevant information between a lot of lines unimportant for the task, 

extracting the dev-relevant information from logs and present only them in a structured way could be improvement on dev productivity, 

traditional: regexes built for exact information extraction

hard to maintain, regex understanding effort, don't generalize / have to be redone when a bulidlog changes / language or build tool is switched, 

... what we do: collected a diverse set of buildlogs from travis ci, designed a metamodel of the contained (extractable?) information, labeled the collected buildlogs, built a tool which uses the PROSE library and can extract information from buildlogs based on examples, evaluated tool/learning ability/accuracy on created dataset, results ...

explicit: contributions

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Continuous Integration}
several researchers done this and that

The software engineering research community started looking into buildlogs as more as continuous integration becomes a vital part of a modern software engineering process.
Seo et al.~\cite{seo2014programmers} found that few error types such as dependency issues and type mismatches are most prominent cause of build failures at google and that most failures are resolved within two builds.
Vassalo et al.~\cite{vassallo2017a-tale} found that the reasons for CI builds to fail are very different at open source and industrial projects using java. 
Beller et al.~\cite{beller2017oops} 
3 log analysis papers


\subsection{Tool}
improving time developers take to understand buildlogs, vasallo by summarizing relevant information in java/maven buildlogs and augmenting with links to related stack overflow  posts, amar et al. (by removing lines that appear both in passing and failing buildlogs and therefore) reducing the lines needed to be inspected, information retrieval techniques to identify most important lines for investigation and categorize the build failure cause

bart paper, icse paper???

relation to our work: we could support this research by enabling easier data extraction from the analyzed buildlogs, most focus on single/few languages with our tool they could more easily cover multiple ones 


\subsection{Information Extraction and Retrieval}
flashextract paper, icse paper???

Le et al. developed FlashExtract as part of the PROSE Framework, tool to synthesize programs based on a few given examples, extract substrings from semi-structured texts, users can extract multiple fields and structure them with hierarchy and sequence, uses inductive synthesis algorithm to synthesize intended program, eliminates the need for the user to understand structure of entire document or to be able to code

we are applying their library to the domain of buildlogs, using programming by example to take away the need to tediously develop and maintain the regular expressions, traditionally used in information extraction

\section{Method}
\subsection{Data collection}
describe process of collecting buildlog files, sampling
querying ghtorrent and travis api with (insert fancy name for data collection tool) for x buildlogs of each status of the top-watched repositories on github that also use travis ci,
\subsection{Meta-Model}
through manual examination of y of the buildlogs we collected designed a metamodell  of the contained/extractable/useful/interesting information,

... explain metamodel + figure ...
\subsection{Our Tool}
... interaction and usage and output of tool, maybe integration possibilities ...

... necessary or interesting implementation details ...

\section{Results}
... achieved accuracy, samples needed for same accuracy as related tools (travistorrent), aging of learned programs with newer data ...

\section{Analysis}
... our tool works well for defined cases, limitations of tool/prose/regex usage in general, every x weeks extraction has to be rewritten to keep accuracy, well improved if only y new examples have to be added ...

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
... repeat everything and results ...

... future: make avaliable to other researchers, integrate into travis, common extend evaluation and data collection, use dataset to evaluate against existing approaches ...
