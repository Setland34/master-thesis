Find a more in-depth documentation of our extraction possibilities [here](tool/readme.md)!

[Learn what we can extract and not extract with PROSE synthesized programs.](docs/what-can-we-extract.md)

For documentation on the Programming by Example data extraction tool look at the [Readme](pbe-extraction-buildlogs/readme.md) in the tool implementation folder.

Our data collection is described [here](data-collection/readme.md) and implemented [here](data-collection/collect-travis-logs.rb)

You can find an overview on what I have worked on recently in the  [Worklog](docs/worklog.md)
