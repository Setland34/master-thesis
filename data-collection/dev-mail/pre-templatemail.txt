Subject: Is this why Travis CI build <%= build_num %> for the repository <%= repo_name %> failed?

<p>
Hey <%= dev_name %>!
</p><p><br/>
I am Carolin, and I am studying methods to automatically extract the reason why a build failed from a Travis CI build log. 
</p><p>
I have seen that you are using Travis CI heavily in the <%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %> repo on GitHub and came across <%= mail_count %> of your builds there.
<br>Would you help me by validating whether the reason I extracted for why the build failed is correct?
<br>Shouldn't take you more than five minutes, and helps me a lot!
</p>
