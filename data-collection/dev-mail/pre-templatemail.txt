Subject: Is this why Travis CI build <%= build_num %> for the repository <%= repo_name %> failed?

<p>
Hey <%= dev_name %>!
</p><p><br/>
We* are a team of researchers from the Software Engineering Research Group of the Technical University of Delft, Netherlands 
and we are studying different tools that extract the reason why a build failed from a Travis CI build log. 
</p><p>
For our evaluation we collected a dataset of various failed builds from popular GitHub repositories.
Today we are writing you because <%= mail_count %> of the build logs we analyzed were created from builds that were triggered by commits you made :)
</p><p>
Below you will find a question for every build log we collected from your commits.
If you want to help us improve our tool, it would be great if you take a few minutes of your time to answer. Just one answer is already helping us!
</p><p>
Thank you a lot for sharing your expertise with us!
</p><p><br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Carolin Brandt

PS. This is the only mail you will ever receive from us on this regard.<br/>
