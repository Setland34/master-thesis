Subject: Is this why build <%= build_num %> for <%= repo_name %> failed?

Hey <%= dev_name %>!

You authored commit <%= commit_sha %> on the <%= commit_date %>, which lead to the failed build <%= build_num %> [<a href="https://travis-ci.org/<%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>/builds/<%= build_id %>">Link to the build in Travis CI.</a>]

We are a team of researchers from the Software Engineering Research Group of the Technical University of Delft, Netherlands and we are studying different tools that extract the reason why a build failed from a Travis CI build log. 

We believe this is the reason why it failed (extracted from <a href="https://travis-ci.org/<%= repository_owner %>/<%= repository_name %>/jobs/<%= job_id %>">the full Travis log</a>):
<pre>
<code>
<%=  extraction %>
</code>
</pre>

Please help us by saying whether we were right!
