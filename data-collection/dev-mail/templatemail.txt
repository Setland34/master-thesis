Subject: Is this why Travis CI build <%= build_num %> for the repository <%= repo_name %> failed?

<p>
Hey <%= dev_name %>!
</p><p><br/>
On the <%= commit_date %>, you authored commit <%= commit_sha %> in <%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>, which lead to the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/<%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>/builds/<%= build_id %>">failed build <%= build_num %> on Travis CI.</a>
</p><p>
We* are a team of researchers from the Software Engineering Research Group of the Technical University of Delft, Netherlands and we are studying different tools that extract the reason why a build failed from a Travis CI build log. 
</p><p>
We believe this is the reason why it failed (extracted from <a href="https://travis-ci.org/<%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>/jobs/<%= job_id %>">the full Travis log</a>):
<pre>
<code>
<%=  extraction %>
</code>
</pre>
</p><p>
Please help us by saying whether we were right:

<a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/5234816/Build-Failure-Reason-Validation?id=<%= build_id %>&extractioncorrect=false">Not quite...</a> 
(This links to a survey to record your answer, and if you want you can improve our work by telling us what would have been correct :D )
</p><p>
Thank you a lot for sharing your expertise with us!
