------------------------------
</p><p>
On the <%= commit_date %>, you authored commit <%= commit_sha %> in <%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>, which lead to the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/<%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>/builds/<%= build_id %>">failed build <%= build_num %> on Travis CI.</a>
</p><p>
We believe this is the reason why it failed (extracted from <a href="https://travis-ci.org/<%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>/jobs/<%= job_id %>">the full Travis log</a>):
<pre>
<code>
<%=  extraction %>
</code>
