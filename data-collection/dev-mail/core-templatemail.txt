<p>
<%= mail_index %>) On <%= commit_date %>, you authored <a href="https://github.com/<%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>/commit/<%= commit_sha_long %>">commit <%= commit_sha_short %></a>, which lead to the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/<%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>/builds/<%= build_id %>">failed build <%= build_num %> on Travis CI.</a>
</p><p>
I believe this is the reason why it failed (extracted from <a href="https://travis-ci.org/<%= repo_owner %>/<%= repo_name %>/<%= jobs_url_job_id %>">the full Travis log</a>):

<code>
<%=  extraction %>

Please help us by saying whether we were right:

(This links to a very short survey to record your answer, and if you want you can improve our work by telling us what would have been correct :D )
