# Unofficial Thesis Template

This is an unofficial template for writing your thesis.
Please check the official guidelines of your university/department before submitting and adjust your thesis if needed.

## Quickstart

As I don't want to overload the README with tons of text and I don't want to repeat everything written in other files, I just give the most important information:

A good starting point for your exploration of the template is `main.tex` since it includes and calls all the other files consecutively.

The detailed instruction, backgrounds, and several snippets are given directly inside the tex-files (mostly inside the txt-folder) and hence can be read in the generated main.pdf.

If you want to use the given Makefile, just use the `make` command to build the pdf and `make clean` to clean up the directory again.
For information about more advanced commands try `make help`.

Enjoy the template and happy thesis writing!
