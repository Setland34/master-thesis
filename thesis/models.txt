Introduction to Chunk Retrieval Techniques

This chapter introduces the concept of chunk retrieval techniques.
We use these techniques to extract text chunks from build logs that represent a specific, targeted information.
This chapter first presents how a build log, the input to our chunk retrieval, is created by a continuous integration (CI) build.
Next, it describes retrievable information chunks in build logs and gives examples found in Travis CI build logs.
We illustrate why it is useful to extract the presented information chunks.
The following section introduces our concept of chunk retrieval techniques, which retrieve information chunks from build logs.
We present the three chunk retrieval techniques we investigate for this thesis:
Program synthesis by example (PBE), common text similarity (CTS) and keyword search (KWS).








Characteristics of a Build Log

The idea of CI is to catch errors early, by integrating new software changes fast and often
