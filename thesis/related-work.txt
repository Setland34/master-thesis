Background

This section presents various research works adjacent or foundational to our work.
To start, we describe studies about continuous integration (CI) and how they gather information about CI usage in software projects.
Next, the section moves on to works about build log analysis and their augmentation, which are related to the techniques we analyze in this thesis.
We differentiate our work from system log analysis and show how we classify build logs as semi-structured data.
The section describes how chunk retrieval can be employed as a part of presented information extraction approaches.
We introduce how information retrieval techniques, the basis for CTS, are used to improve software development.
Lastly this section mentions different Programming by Example resources surrounding Microsoft's work on the PROSE library, the foundation of PBE.


Continuous Integration
This section starts with an overview on research into why CI is used and its impact on development.
It presents analyses on why CI builds fail and how testing and static analysis tools are used within CI.
We explain how researchers compose data sets for their work on CI and how chunk retrieval techniques can support them.
